A starter repository to introduce myself with the GitHub environment

This is a repository for my Python program.

- I have enjoyed working in Python so far this semester
- It's a pretty **simple** language with a lot less syntax than others
- However, it is *still* **unforgiving, especially with spacing**

## Some of My Assignments so Far This Semester
1. square_calculator.py
2. payroll.py
3. is_it_positive.py
4. nested_if_statements.py

## My Favorite Coding Languages so Far
1. Java
2. C++
3. Python
4. html
